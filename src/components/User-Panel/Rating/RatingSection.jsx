    reviewBody: 'Harishchandragad and Kokankada (via Khireshwar): Being a newbie in trekking, it\'s important to know your limits. This is supposed to be a fun and enjoyable experience, not painstakingly difficult. I personally made this mistake by attempting to climb Harishchandragad (via khireshwar) despite having any previous trekking experience. But hats off to all the Sahyadri vacations team for leading us safely to and from the location. Patiently supporting and encouraging throughout the journey, LOADS of fun, new friends, new experiences! Nice food and travel management. Loved it!!'

The trek leaders always make sure to educate everyone about our history and significance of the place we are visiting. I have always felt safe throughout every trek.

    reviewBody: 'I recently had the pleasure of embarking on the Andharban Jungle Trek with Sahyadri Vacations. It was my fourth trekking experience with them. Trekking through the dense forest was a truly memorable adventure. Sahyadri Vacations\' organization was impeccable from start to finish. Our trek leaders, Venkatesh, Janhavi, Sairaj, and Shivam, were outstanding. They ensured everything ran smoothly while keeping the group motivated and well-informed. The trek itself was a challenging yet exhilarating journey, requiring over six hours of walking through lush jungle terrain. The guides were incredibly knowledgeable, sharing fascinating insights about the flora and fauna, adding a rich educational aspect to the experience.Overall, I am excited to join them for more treks in the future. If you\'re looking for a well-organized trek with knowledgeable guides, I highly recommend Sahyadri Vacations!'
