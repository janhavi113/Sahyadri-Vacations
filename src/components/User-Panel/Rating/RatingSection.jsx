    reviewBody: 'Harishchandragad and Kokankada (via Khireshwar): Being a newbie in trekking, it\'s important to know your limits. This is supposed to be a fun and enjoyable experience, not painstakingly difficult. I personally made this mistake by attempting to climb Harishchandragad (via khireshwar) despite having any previous trekking experience. But hats off to all the Sahyadri vacations team for leading us safely to and from the location. Patiently supporting and encouraging throughout the journey, LOADS of fun, new friends, new experiences! Nice food and travel management. Loved it!!'
